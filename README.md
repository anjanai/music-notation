**Notate.Music** is a simple html-based tool that allows you to notate Indian music using the Indian system of solfege (sa re ga ma ...). This is intended for musicians who prefer to read and write their notations in the devanagari script. Access the tool [here](https://anjanai.github.io/music-notation/).
